# PostFix-Conversion-Evaluation

This program converts and evaluates arithmetic expressions in infix form:

Each operand is one character long. Operators * and / have the same precedence while + and â€“ have the same precedence. However, * and / have higher precedence than + and -. Order of precedence can be changed by enclosing the operands by a pair of parenthesis. Spaces between operand and operator are optional.
